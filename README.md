# Diffgrad-optimizer-for-enhanced-performance-of-ML-model

Implement a widely used machine learning algorithm using commonly available python libraries and optimize that ML algorithm to reinforce the performance of machine learning algorithm. 
The proposed optimization method should enhance the performance of algorithm and will outperform other methods.
Objectives:
To choose a widely used machine learning algorithm. 
To implement ML algorithm for popular application. 
To optimize the given algorithm to reinforce the performance.
To compare the results of praposed optimization method with methods that are being currently used.
